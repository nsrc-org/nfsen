Quick Notes:
============

This is version 1.3.8 of NfSen. Use least nfdump 1.6.x,
Do not use any earlier nfdump version, such as nfdump 1.5.x
Make sure you have nfdump configured with option --enable-nfprofile

Upgrade is supported only for NfSen versions v1.2.x. 
older NfSen versions need to be upgraded in a first step to NfSen 1.2.4.

What is NfSen:
=============
NfSen is a graphical WEB based front end for the nfdump netflow tools.
See <http://nfdump.sourceforge.net>

With NfSen, you can:
- Display your netflow data from many sources: Flows, Packets and Bytes.
- Easily navigate through the netflow data.
- Process the netflow data within the specified time span.
- Create history as well as continuous profiles.
- Set alerts based on various conditions.
- Write your own plug-ins to process and display netflow data on a regular 
  interval.

NfSen allows you to keep all the convenient advantages of the command 
line using nfdump directly and gives you also a graphical overview over 
your netflow data.

A more detailed documentation is available in the doc directory. 

NfSen is distributed under the BSD license - see BSD-license.txt

Installation:
-------------

1. Prerequisites:
- PHP and Perl:
  NfSen is written in PHP and Perl and should run on any *NIX system.
  At least Perl 5.10.1 and PHP > 4.1 with PHP socket extension is required.
  NfSen also works with PHP 5 and apache 2.
  Perl modules: Mail::Header and Mail::Internet. Install these Perl modules
  prior to installing NfSen.
- RRDtools
  NfSen requires the RRD tools v1.0.x or > 1.2.11, at least the RRDs Perl 
  Module.
- nfdump tools
  Make sure you have at least version 1.6.1 installed on your system. 
  Do not use any older nfdump version!
  Make sure you have nfdump configured with option --enable-nfprofile
  You can download nfdump from sourceforge nfdump.sourceforge.net.
  Please note: Each netflow source requires a semaphore in the global 
  system table. If you have lots of different sources, check the system 
  documentation about the max number of semaphores, or how to increase the 
  this number respectively.

NfSen has a very flexible directory layout. To simplify matters, 
the default layout stores everything but the html pages under BASEDIR. 
However, you may configure NfSen to fit your local needs. 
See the nfsen-dist.conf config file. The netflow data is stored 
under PROFILEDATADIR ( BASEDIR/profiles by default ). So make sure you have 
enough disk space.

To update your current NfSen installation goto point 3.

2. First installation of NfSen:
If you have installed all prerequisites, change to the etc directory and
copy the NfSen config file nfsen-dist.conf to nfsen.conf. Edit nfsen.conf
according your needs and setup. Make sure you have set the right values
for the netflow sources. For any netflow source, make an entry in the 
%sources hash. The comments in nfsen.conf should guide you. When you 
are done, run the install.pl script in the distribution directory:

./install.pl etc/nfsen.conf

Running install.pl will:
- Create the NfSen environment with all required directories.
- Copy the php/html files into HTMLDIR.
- Create the live profile. 
- Prepares the RRD DBs for the live profile.

After the installation, you will find the nfsen.conf file in CONFDIR.

3. Update your current NfSen installation:
Upgrade is supported only for NfSen v1.2.x. Any NfSen 1.1.x installations should
be upgraded in a first step to NfSen 1.2.4.
If you upgrade from any previous NfSen installation, make sure you have
upgraded nfdump to version 1.5.5 according to this README file. 

To upgrade your 1.2.x NfSen installation:

   1.  Stop old nfsen, due to nfprofile incompatibilities.
	   ./nfsen.rc stop
   2.  Upgrade nfdump to stable 1.6.1. Do not forget to configure nfdump
	   with --enable-nfprofile option.
	   This update is required!

   3.  Upgrade NfSen:

      ./install.pl <path/to/your/nfsen/etc/nfsen.conf>

	   This will update your current NfSen installation. and 
       you're done.

   4. If you have plugins installed, check the README.plugins file for some
	  small changes required to be changed for each plugin.
      If you have PortTracker installed, you need to update to the PortTracker
      version included in the contrib directory, coming with NfSen. You need 
	  not to rebuild your current db files, just rebuild nftrack and replace 
	  the plugin files. See the INSTALL file.

   5. Start NfSen:

      BINDIR/nfsen start

When updating from a newer snapshot ( > snapshot-20070110 ) or from early 1.3b 
releases the normal update procedure will do:

      ./install.pl <path/to/your/nfsen/etc/nfsen.conf>
      BINDIR/nfsen reload

4.  NfSen is now ready to use. 

You may want to link the start/stop file BASEDIR/bin/nfsen.rc into your 
appropriate rc.d directory. Start NfSen:

BINDIR/nfsen start

Point your web browser to nfsen.php. 
( Typically http://yourserver/nfsen/nfsen.php )


Notes for Solaris users:
------------------------
To make syslog work for NfSen set the appropriate parameter in nfsen.conf.
See nfsen-dist.conf for the logging socket parameter.

The Sys::Syslog perl Module on Solaris 10 is badly broken. You may want
to upgrade Sys::Syslog to the latest available on CPAN.


Notes on sub directory hierarchy support:
-----------------------------------------
As of snapshot 20060728 nfsen supports the sub directory hierarchy of nfdump. 
When installing or upgrading NfSen, the layout is set to '0' ( see nfcapd(1) ),
which means no layout.  If you want to make use of any sub hierarchy layout, 
add '$SUBDIRLAYOUT = <num>;' to the nfsen.conf file. See nfsen-dist.conf for 
more information. After changing the layout, run RebuildHierarchy.pl. 
in $BINDIR to reorganize the data files to the new layout. Changing the layout 
is possible at any other time later on. However, you must run 
RebuildHierarchy.pl after changing $SUBDIRLAYOUT the config file.
Note: This process will stop NfSen, as the upgrade requires a silent system.

More information about NfSen as well as working with NfSen is available in 
the documentation provided in the doc directory.
