Please note: This is prototype software. Use it at you own risk :)
To install PortTracker, follow the steps below:

*** The sources for nftrack are now included in nfdump and are no longer
included in this contrib directory. ***

1. Get nfdump. You need at least version 1.6.5 or 1.5.8-NSEL.
PortTracker does *NOT* work with nfdump-1.5.x!

2. When building nfdump add --enable-nftrack as confgure parameter
A command may look like: ./configure --enable-nfprofile --enable-nftrack
make; make install will generate the binaries incl. nftrack

3. Create the port DBs in a directory with at least 10GB disk space:
This directory needs to be writable by the user $USER configured in nfsen.conf

4. Edit Porttracker.pm:
Set $PORTSDBDIR to the port DBs directory.

5. Copy PortTracker.pm to the NfSen backend plugin dir.
   Copy PortTracker.php to the NfSen frontend plugin dir.

6. Edit nfsen.conf: Add the plugin for profile 'live': 
Example:
@plugins = (
	[ 'live',   'PortTracker'],
);

7. Initialize the ports-db:
As $USER run 'nftrack -I -d <path-to-ports-DBs>'
This takes some minutes or so ... have a coffee

8. Restart NfSen:
Run './nfsen reload'
Have a look at the syslog file to see if PortTracker loaded successfully:

9. After the next 5min update cycle: Point your browser to the NfSen page 
and select the Plugin Tab.
